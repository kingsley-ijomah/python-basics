'''
1) what are the four data collection types?

2) create examples of each data type

3) what is the difference between a list and a tuple?

4) is a tuple changeable?

5) is a set data structure indexed?

6) what method would you use to freeze a set?

7) from the below what is the index of "Ford"?
